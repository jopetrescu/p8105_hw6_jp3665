## Washington Post homicide data

This data gathered by the Washington Post contains information about the
victim, location, and disposition of over 52,000 homicides that occurred
over the past decade in 50 of the largest cities in the U.S.

Import crime data, create a `city_state` variable, filter out cities
that do not report victim race, add logical column `solved` representing
whether the case has been solved (Closed with arrest or Closed without
arrest), filter to include only crimes with victims that were `White` or
`Black`.

``` r
homicide_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")

homicide_data <- homicide_data %>%
  mutate(.keep = "all", city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) %>%
  filter(city_state != c("Phoenix, AZ", "Dallas, TX", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) %>%
  mutate(solved = as.numeric(disposition != c("Open/No arrest"))) %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) %>%
  select(city_state, solved, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)



head(homicide_data)
```

    ##        city_state solved victim_age victim_race victim_sex
    ## 1 Albuquerque, NM      1         15       White     Female
    ## 2 Albuquerque, NM      1         72       White     Female
    ## 3 Albuquerque, NM      0         91       White     Female
    ## 4 Albuquerque, NM      0         56       White       Male
    ## 5 Albuquerque, NM      1         NA       White       Male
    ## 6 Albuquerque, NM      1         43       White     Female

### Generalized linear model for solving homicides by race

Using Baltimore, MD as an example, use a generalized linear model to
calculate odds ratio and confidence intervals for solving homicides
comparing non-white victims to white victims, keeping age and sex fixed.

``` r
baltimore_glm <- homicide_data %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%
  mutate(victim_race = factor(victim_race, levels = c("White", "Black"))) %>%
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate), OR_min = exp(estimate - std.error), OR_max = exp(estimate + std.error)) %>%
  mutate(across(is.numeric, ~ round(., 3))) %>%
  mutate(CI = (paste(OR_min, OR_max, sep = "-"))) %>%
  select(term, OR, CI)

baltimore_glm %>% filter(term == "victim_raceBlack") %>% knitr::kable()
```

| term              |    OR | CI         |
| :---------------- | ----: | :--------- |
| victim\_raceBlack | 0.407 | 0.34-0.487 |

Iterate across all cities to calculate odds ratio and confidence
intervals for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white
victims, keeping age and sex fixed.

``` r
homicide_data <- homicide_data %>%
  mutate(victim_race = factor(victim_race, levels = c("White", "Black")))

homicide_nest <- homicide_data %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL")

homicide_glm <- homicide_nest %>%
  mutate(
    results = map(data, ~glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial()) %>%
                    broom::tidy())
  ) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate), OR_min = exp(estimate - std.error), OR_max = exp(estimate + std.error)) %>%
  mutate(across(is.numeric, ~ round(., 3))) %>%
  mutate(CI = (paste(OR_min, OR_max, sep = "-"))) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_raceBlack") 

homicide_glm %>%  select(city_state, OR, CI) %>% knitr::kable()

## Factors affecting children’s birthweight

Load birthweight data and recode variables

``` r
birthweight_data <- read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(babysex = recode(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female")) %>%
  mutate(frace = recode(frace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other", "9" = "Unknown")) %>%

### Linear model for factors affecting children’s birthweight

Exploring correlations of mother’s weight gain, gestational age,
pre-pregnancy BMI, and pre-pregnancy weight with birth weight. Mother’s
weight gain and gestational age seem to be positively correlated with
birth weight in this dataset whereas there seems to be no association
between pre-pregnancy BMI or pre-pregnancy weight with birth wight.

``` r
birthweight_data %>% ggplot(aes(x = wtgain, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point()
```

In addition to the positive correlations identified above, I know that
research has shown that smoking during pregnancy is associated with
decreased birthweight. Therefore, my proposed linear model for this
birth weight data uses gestational age, mother’s weight gain during
pregnancy, and average number of cigarettes smoked per day during
pregnancy.

``` r
smoking_fit <- lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + smoken + wtgain, data = birthweight_data) 

length_fit <- lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight_data)

circumference_fit <- lm(bwt ~ (bhead + blength + babysex)^2, data = birthweight_data)
```

Plot model birth weight predictions and residuals against birth weight.

``` r
smoking_fit %>% broom::tidy() %>% select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 200)
```

| term        |   estimate |       p.value |
| :---------- | ---------: | ------------: |

| gaweeks     |  62.848199 | 3.334345e-163 |
| smoken      | \-6.558218 |  2.194449e-12 |
| wtgain      |   9.006826 |  2.043564e-44 |

``` r
birthweight_data <- birthweight_data %>% modelr::add_predictions(smoking_fit) %>% modelr::add_residuals(smoking_fit)

birthweight_data %>% ggplot(aes(x = bwt, y = pred)) +
  geom_point()
